## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization

I have done Extensive data visualization it carried out to gain insights into the dataset:

- **Correlation Heatmap:** Identified relationships among features like pH, hardness, solids, and turbidity.
- **Boxplots & Histograms:** Detected outliers and observed feature distributions.
- **Pairplots:** Visualized class separation and inter-feature patterns.
- **Target Balance Visualization:** Analyzed distribution of the target variable (potability).

These visualizations helped in understanding feature importance and dataset characteristics, guiding model selection and preprocessing.
