# Water Quality Prediction - RMS

This project aims to predict multiple water quality parameters using machine learning techniques, specifically `MultiOutputRegressor` wrapped around a `RandomForestRegressor`. It was developed as part of a one-month **AICTE Virtual Internship sponsored by Shell** in **June 2025**.

---

## Overview

Access to clean water is a critical global concern. Accurate prediction of various water quality metrics can help in early detection of pollution and ensure timely intervention.

In this project, we:

- Collected and preprocessed real-world water quality datasets
- Used supervised machine learning for multi-target regression
- Built a pipeline using `MultiOutputRegressor` with `RandomForestRegressor`
- Evaluated the model using appropriate regression metrics

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.12**
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data handling
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning model and evaluation
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive experimentation

---

## Predicted Water Quality Parameters

The model predicts multiple water quality parameters such as:

- NH4
- BOD5 (BSK5)
- Colloids
- O2, NO3, NO2, SO4, PO4 and 
- CL

## Model Performance

The model was evaluated using:

- **R² Score**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**

Performance was acceptable across all parameters
