#Water_Quality_Prediction_AICTE
Project Title: Water Quality prediction Using AI

Overview

This project was developed as part of the Shell Edunet Skills4Future AICTE Virtual Internship (June 2025). It uses machine learning to predict multiple water quality parameters based on historical data from 22 monitoring stations along the Southern Bug River. By leveraging AI, the goal is to support environmental monitoring and sustainability efforts.

Technologies Used

Python 3.12 â€“ Programming Language Pandas, NumPy â€“ Data Handling & Processing Scikit-learn â€“ Machine Learning Model & Evaluation Matplotlib, Seaborn â€“ Data Visualization Jupyter Notebook â€“ Interactive Experimentation

Predicted Water Quality Parameters

NH4
BOD5 (BSK5) Colloids O2 NO3 NO2 SO4 PO4 CL

Project Goals ðŸ”¹ Build a machine learning model for predicting water quality ðŸ”¹ Analyze environmental trends using real-world datasets ðŸ”¹ Apply AI to support sustainable water resource management
